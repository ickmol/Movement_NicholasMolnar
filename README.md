Best used on Sphere RigidBody with mass 1

The movement script that I have made today works best when applied to a sphere with a lower mass as rolling is made far easier. This is how the script is optimized however by changing to forcemode in the .AddForce, or even changing the base movement speed, far easier, and especially unique, movements can be made on the predetermined rigidbody gameobject. The control scheme of the script harnesses GetButtonDown() and GetAxis() rather than checking for Key inputs. This allows the script to be more universally controllable due to GetButtonDown() and GetAxis() also checking for connected controllers/gamepads, accomodates users on DVORAK or other international keyboard layouts different to QWERTY, and other specified equipment predetermined by Unity's engine. While the movement feels as fluid as a rollerball style controller should feel, the jumping feels slightly odd as jump inputs must be registered within fixed update frames rather than at will, leaving the player with less control over jumping. Jumping also doesn't check if it is grounded, this may be solved with a short raycast checking for ground changing a boolean which may be added to the jump() if statement with &&. Overall the script is very universal however and the only real limitations are infinite jumps, limited characters based on colliders, and oddities with jumping in a fixedupdate().
